# Sistema_bancario

That's one of my first web app school project.

Together with Diogo (A classmate at that time), we made a simple banking system.

It was the kickstart of my life as a developer, and it showed me how much i loved coding on my nights/evenings.

Learned alot of the basics while developing this project.
